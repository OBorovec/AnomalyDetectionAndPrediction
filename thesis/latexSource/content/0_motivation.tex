\chapter*{Motivation}

\ms{Takové zvláštní mít toto ještě před abstraktem a kompletně mimo všechny sekce. Hodil bych to spíš do první kapitoly úvod / motivace / \dots}

During my studies I had an internship and later a regular job as a DevOps Engineer. The team, I was part of, is responsible for running a big cluster of NoSQL storage with surrounding infrastructure in multiple separated zones of the world as an internal logging platform. You can definitely image\ms{,} we were facing some problems nearly every day and more than an DevOps Engineer I felt as a PostOps when we were trying to figure out the root cause of the problems. It was never easy, because during the down-times of our service we were under a big pressure going though log files and running several analysis tools.

At the time we would give nearly everything to have a reliable solution which would warn us in advance so we had more time to react. But we were not satisfied with any existing solution around. Since we were dealing with structured data and time series, my main field of study - Applied machine learning comes really handy. So, when I started to think about my master thesis this was the natural choice, because I wanted to work on something I know and from what others could benefit as well.

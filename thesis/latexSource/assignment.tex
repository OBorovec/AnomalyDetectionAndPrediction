Title of Master Project: Anomaly detection in complex IT architectures 

Guidelines:
1. Review existing approaches designed to detect anomalies in software architecture monitoring systems
2. Create or collect a dataset of monitoring-related information
3. Select several suitable machine learning methods for the problem and customize them for the given task
4. Experimentally evaluate the selected methods on the dataset
